### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*

**App Service:** 
*App services are less expensive even though we are paying for a plan even when we are not using it, I mean it does not have a pay as you go service, for a small and lightweight application as the CMS, I think this is the best option because it requires less effort for the implementation.

**VM:**
*Azure VMs are more expensive and require more operational work to install and configure anything that we want for the application, some of the advantages are that we have more control over the system, but it also means that we are going to need more qualified professional for security and configuration.

**In summary, in this case we can use both options, but the best one is App services because it simplicity and has the neccesary for this lightweight application.

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.* 
If the CMS requires more resources first we should identify if we could use and scale-up or scale-out option in order to increment the resources and capacity for the application.

If it needs more resources then we have to identify the requirement and professional work that we are going to require for the administration, configuration, and security for the applications and VM.
